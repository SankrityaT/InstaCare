## 🚀 Investor Pitch Strategy (BE HONEST)

### Opening:
"We've built an AI-powered platform to help patients find the fastest ER care. We're currently in **pilot phase** with a focus on San Diego."

### The Truth:
"Right now, our predictions are based on:
- Historical wait time patterns
- Real-time weather conditions
- Traffic patterns
- Time of day and seasonal factors
- Hospital characteristics (size, staffing, type)

We're actively pursuing partnerships with hospital networks to integrate real-time data feeds."

### The Vision:
"Once we have hospital partnerships, our AI will combine:
- Real-time ER occupancy from hospital EMR systems
- Current wait times from hospital feeds
- Our predictive factors (weather, traffic, events)
- User-reported data for verification

This creates the most accurate wait time predictions in the market."
